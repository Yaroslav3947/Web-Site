# Weather Forecast Web App
This is a basic web application that allows users to enter a city name and obtain the current temperature in Celsius for that city, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API.

Users can simply enter the name of the city in the input field and click on the "Find" button to get the current temperature. The application also offers an autocomplete feature that displays a list of cities that match the user's input as they type.
